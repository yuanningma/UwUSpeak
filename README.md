# UwUSpeak
This is a silly little project to transform any phrase into "uwuspeak" by replacing "l"'s and "r"'s with "w"'s, adding y's
to "m" and "w" before vowels, replacing the first "th" with "d", and a few other changes.

Currently working on adding random Japanese suffixes to names it encounters -> will update later
